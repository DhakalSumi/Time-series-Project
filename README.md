# Time Series Forecasting Project

## Purpose of the Project
This project aims to analyze and forecast time series data from January to March using multiple machine learning and deep learning models. The objective is to compare and evaluate different forecasting techniques to determine the most effective model for accurate predictions.

## Models Used
To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the following models were implemented:
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A statistical model suitable for univariate time series forecasting.
- **SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: An extension of ARIMA that incorporates seasonality, making it ideal for periodic data.
- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**: A powerful ensemble learning method known for handling non-linear patterns effectively.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A deep learning model that excels in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.

## Justification of Model Choices
- **ARIMA & SARIMA** were selected due to their strong performance in traditional time series forecasting and their ability to model trends and seasonality effectively.
- **XGBoost** was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex relationships within the data.
- **LSTM** was included to leverage deep learningâ€™s capability in learning temporal dependencies over long sequences.

## Model Performance
Performance evaluation was conducted using metrics such as:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

The comparison of models helped identify which method performed best for this particular dataset, taking into account both accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Streamlit Application
A Streamlit-based web application was developed to allow users to:
- Upload and visualize time series data.
- Select different forecasting models.
- Generate and display predictions interactively.
- Compare model performance using various evaluation metrics.

The interactive dashboard provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making time series forecasting accessible to a broader audience.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the strengths and limitations of different time series forecasting models. By integrating both traditional statistical approaches and advanced machine learning/deep learning techniques, it provides a holistic understanding of time series forecasting.
